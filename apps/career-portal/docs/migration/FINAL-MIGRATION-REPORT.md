# Final Migration Report

**Date:** 2026-07-12  
**Source:** `career.fmpg/mern` — unchanged, read-only reference  
**Target:** `career.fmpg/career-portal`

## 1. Migration summary

A separate Next.js 16 modular-monolith application now implements the major public, candidate, employee, HR, administrator, document, onboarding, notification, audit, and operational workflows discovered in the MERN source. Existing MongoDB collection and field compatibility is represented through Prisma mappings. Security defects found in the legacy application were not intentionally reproduced.

## 2. Architecture

- Next.js 16 App Router, React 19.2, strict TypeScript, Turbopack.
- React Server Components by default with focused client islands.
- Prisma MongoDB preserving ObjectIds and mapped legacy collections.
- Better Auth secure-cookie sessions with legacy bcrypt verification compatibility.
- Zod validation, TanStack Form, TanStack Query, scoped Zustand.
- Tailwind CSS 4, Radix/shadcn-style primitives, Lucide and Motion.
- Domain services isolate database, authorization, email, media, PDF, encryption and workflow logic.

## 3. Migrated feature list

- Public homepage, jobs discovery/detail, contact, sitemap, robots and metadata.
- Registration, verification email, login/logout/session monitoring, password reset.
- Candidate application, resume parsing, custom questions/files, owned application tracking and signed resume access.
- Recruitment dashboard, jobs/questions/images, application detail/status/rejection/welcome actions.
- Certificates and offers: issue/list, bulk offer CSV, PDFs, QR verification, email, extension/status/token workflows.
- Token-bound offer response and encrypted contract onboarding.
- Private contract documents, HR contract review/status/PDF.
- User/employee lifecycle, bulk secure onboarding, HR permissions and assigned jobs.
- Employee profile, recommendations, reviews and moderation.
- User/admin notifications and redacted audit logs.
- Health/readiness, headers/CORS, rate limiting, structured errors/logging, persistent email attempts/outbox-lite events and migration backfill tooling.

## 4. Feature parity percentage

The migration ledger currently contains mostly `IMPLEMENTED` capabilities with remaining platform and runtime proof items marked `IN_PROGRESS`. **Code-level implementation coverage is approximately 90%. Verified parity remains lower because dual-application fixture-driven tests have not run against a working legacy environment and production-like Mongo replica set.** No untested capability is mislabeled `VERIFIED`.

## 5. UI parity

Public and auth surfaces preserve the source emerald/slate theme, DM Sans/Outfit typography, responsive navigation, cards, forms and state patterns. Responsive Playwright smoke checks pass at 375, 768, 1024 and 1440 pixels. Deterministic MERN-vs-Next screenshot approval is still pending.

## 6. API migration

Next Route Handlers and server-domain calls cover the active application workflows. Compatibility aliases are not universally retained for dead or unsupported legacy client methods. Error responses are standardized and request-correlated.

## 7. MongoDB compatibility

Prisma uses the MongoDB provider, mapped legacy collection names, ObjectId fields, embedded composites and mapped enums. A dry-run-first job slug/publication backfill exists. Final production compatibility requires live read-only profiling, index comparison, backup and migration rehearsal.

## 8. Authentication migration

Better Auth is configured with secure cookies, custom bcrypt verification, email verification/reset delivery, status enforcement and server-controlled roles. An idempotent `auth:migrate`/`auth:migrate:apply` process creates credential Account records from valid legacy bcrypt hashes. The current seeded database was migrated successfully and legacy credential login was verified. Legacy JWT sessions are not automatically converted.

## 9. Test coverage

- Prisma schema validation: passed.
- Strict TypeScript: passed.
- ESLint with zero warnings: passed.
- Vitest: **37 tests passed** across schemas, authorization, transitions, CSV, parsing, encryption/QR and transformations.
- Playwright: **32 passed, 16 skipped** across four required viewports. Skips are environment/fixture-dependent parity cases.
- Production Turbopack build: passed; 51 routes/pages generated.

## 10. Remaining blockers

1. A correctly initialized MongoDB replica set with a sanitized production-like snapshot.
2. Simultaneously runnable MERN and Next environments with deterministic fixtures.
3. SMTP, Cloudinary and reCAPTCHA sandbox integration proof.
4. Distributed production rate limiter/worker infrastructure selection.
5. Legacy binary `.doc` parsing remains unsupported; PDF and DOCX are supported with strict bounds.
6. Scheduled media orphan reconciliation and full migration rollback rehearsal.

## 11. Security improvements

- No public privileged role assignment.
- Secure-cookie sessions instead of authoritative localStorage JWTs.
- Account-status enforcement and centralized permission/assignment policies.
- One-time hashed offer/contract tokens with expiry and replay protection.
- Application-level AES-256-GCM encryption for banking and identity values.
- Private uploads, MIME/magic-byte/size validation, signed access and cleanup.
- Ownership/assignment protection for applications, resumes, recommendations and documents.
- Redacted public verification, contract and audit projections.
- Idempotent outbox/email attempts, structured redacted logs, request IDs, CORS and security headers.

## 12. Performance improvements

- Server Components for initial reads.
- Bounded pagination, parsing, CSV rows/files and uploads.
- Indexed/scoped Prisma queries.
- Optimized Next images and route-level code splitting.
- Durable asynchronous-work records rather than unreliable post-response `setImmediate` behavior.

## 13. Known behavior differences

- Secure token links replace weak public application/offer identifiers.
- Password recovery uses secure links instead of plaintext OTP storage.
- Public verification omits sensitive compensation/contact information.
- Bulk onboarding uses reset links instead of emailed plaintext passwords.
- Invalid direct-route access is denied server-side even where legacy UI guards were permissive.
- Unknown routes use a real 404 instead of silently rendering Home.
- Legacy `.doc` resume parsing is not supported.

## 14. Production readiness assessment

**Conditionally ready for staging, not yet approved for production cutover.** Static quality gates, unit tests, responsive smoke tests and production build pass. Production approval requires the blockers above, especially live-data rehearsal, existing-user auth migration, provider sandbox tests, distributed operations decisions and dual-app parity execution. The legacy application must remain available until those gates pass.
